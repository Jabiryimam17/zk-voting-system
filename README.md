## 📦 Project Summary
This system enables anonymous, eligibility‑verified voting where:
- No plaintext identity leaves the client.
- Every vote is linked to a real identity (via encrypted database + Merkle proofs) without revealing who.
- Double‑voting is prevented using nullifiers.
- Verification happens on‑chain and in zero knowledge.


## 🧩 Encrypted National ID Database (External System)
- Stores AES‑256‑GCM encrypted citizen records.
- Each encrypted entry is a Poseidon leaf in a Merkle tree.
- Provides the Merkle root and per‑voter Merkle paths to the voting client.


## 🧠 Client‑Side Flow
1) User enters ID + password
- PBKDF2 derives AES key → decrypts identity secret + nullifier seed.

2) Build zk witness in browser
- Provide decrypted private inputs + Merkle path + root to the circuit.

3) Generate proof (WASM + snarkjs)
- Send only proof and public inputs (root, nullifier, etc.) to chain.


## 🗳️ ZK Circuit Guarantees
- Voter exists in the encrypted national database (Merkle inclusion).
- Government reference root matches.
- Identity remains hidden; only commitments are public.
- Nullifier prevents double‑voting.

## Contracts (frontend/ethereum/contracts)
This repository includes two Solidity helper contracts used in the system flow. Core Verifier and Voting contracts are referenced by addresses in `.env` and are expected to be deployed separately (e.g., in a Hardhat/Foundry project).

1) PartyManager.sol
- Purpose: Integrates with a Chainlink oracle to verify that a political party exists/is eligible according to an off‑chain registry (served by the backend). When verified, it records the party as eligible on‑chain.
- Key pieces:
  - Uses `ChainlinkClient` and `ConfirmedOwner`.
  - `set_host(string)` sets the backend API base (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).
  - `verify_party(...)` builds a Chainlink request to `GET <host>/is_party_exist?party_id=<ID>` and expects a JSON boolean at path `party_exist`.
  - `fulfill_verification_party(requestId, party_exist)` is the oracle callback. If `true`, it marks the party as verified in contract storage.
- System flow:
  1. Admin/owner triggers a verification request for a party.
  2. Chainlink oracle calls the backend endpoint.
  3. Backend responds; oracle returns `party_exist`.
  4. Contract marks the party verified; downstream contracts can then rely on this mapping to allow ballot registration or vote attribution.
- Notes:
  - Oracle, LINK token, fee, and jobId are currently constants/in‑contract. In production, parameterize via constructor or setters.
  - For safety, only the owner can initiate sensitive actions.

2) TreasureManager.sol
- Purpose: Treasury utilities for recovering assets held by the contract (LINK and native ETH). Useful when the contract receives funds to pay oracle fees or as part of admin workflows.
- Key pieces:
  - `withdraw_link()` transfers all LINK in the contract back to the owner.
  - `transfer_ether()` sends native ETH balance to the owner.
  - `withdraw_assets()` performs both, intended for internal/owner‑only usage.
- System flow:
  - After oracle jobs, recover leftover LINK/ETH to the admin wallet.

Referenced (external) contracts
- Verifier (Groth16): Deployed verifier that checks zk‑SNARK proofs produced by the Circom circuit.
- Voting: Maintains election state, accepted Merkle root(s), tracks nullifiers to prevent double‑votes, and records votes only if the verifier approves the proof and the nullifier is fresh.

Why split the contracts?
- Separation of concerns: zk verification (Verifier) vs application logic (Voting) vs oracle/treasury utilities (PartyManager/TreasureManager).
- Security and upgradability: you can rotate or upgrade the verifier without changing voting logic, and adjust oracle endpoints independently.


## Chainlink Oracle Lifecycle (Party Verification)
- Configure: `VERIFY_JOB_ID`, `ORACLE_ADDRESS`, `LINK_TOKEN_ADDRESS` in `.env` (see mapping below) and ensure the contract has LINK to pay fees.
- Request: `PartyManager.verify_party(...)` sends the request with the party id.
- Fulfill: Oracle calls `fulfill_verification_party` with the boolean result.
- Persist: Contract marks the party verified in storage.


## ZK Proving Pipeline (Groth16)
1) Circuit: `frontend/PROOF/VerifyVoter.circom`
2) Compile and setup (developer flow):
```
circom frontend/PROOF/VerifyVoter.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym -o frontend/PROOF/build
snarkjs groth16 setup frontend/PROOF/build/VerifyVoter.r1cs \
  frontend/PROOF/powersOfTau28_hez_final_17.ptau \
  frontend/PROOF/build/VerifyVoter_0000.zkey
snarkjs zkey export verifier frontend/PROOF/build/VerifyVoter_0000.zkey \
  frontend/PROOF/build/Verifier.sol
```
3) Frontend runtime:
- Build witness in browser → run WASM → create proof via `snarkjs`.
- Submit proof + public inputs (Merkle root, nullifier, etc.) to the on‑chain Verifier and Voting contracts.


## Environment Variables (root .env)
These variables connect the app to Sepolia contracts and the Chainlink oracle:
- VERIFY_JOB_ID=c1c5…aa3 — Chainlink job id used by PartyManager.
- ORACLE_ADDRESS=0x6090…9eFD — Chainlink operator/oracle address.
- LINK_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x7798…4789 — LINK token on Sepolia.
- ELECTION_CONTRACT_ADDRESS — Deployed Voting contract address.
- VERIFIER_ADDRESS — Deployed Verifier contract address.
- RPC_URL / RPC_API_KEY / CHAIN_ID — Network provider configuration (Sepolia = 11155111).
- DB_* — Backend MySQL connectivity.
- JWT_SECRET_KEY, APP_PASSWORD, EMAIL_SENDER — App security and notifications.


## Running (Development)
Backend API (Express):
```
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Frontend (Next.js):
```
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Cross‑origin config: backend CORS allows `http://localhost:3000` with credentials.


## End‑to‑End Voting Flow
1) Admin sets the current Merkle root in the Voting contract and funds oracle/LINK as needed.
2) Voter logs into the client, decrypts their identity secrets (AES‑GCM via PBKDF2 password key).
3) Client builds the zk witness with Merkle path + commitments, generates proof.
4) Client submits transaction: `verify(proof)` on Verifier → Voting consumes the result + checks nullifier is unused → records vote.
5) If party eligibility is required, `PartyManager` verifies off‑chain party registry via Chainlink before allowing party to be listed/selected.


## Security Considerations
- Nullifiers prevent double‑votes; always check and mark nullifiers in Voting.
- Only ciphertext and commitments leave the client; plaintext identity never leaves the device.
- Hardcode minimization: prefer constructor/setter injection for oracle/job/token addresses.
- Rate limiting and session hardening on the backend; protect `/is_party_exist` and any sensitive endpoints.
